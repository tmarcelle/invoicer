# Invoice Generating Application
Single Page invoicer application made with html, petite-vue, purecss

## Why was this created
Spent sometime searching for a simple free way to create/ generate an invoice and could not find anything that didn't require me to sign up or pay.

## How to use
Pretty straightforward, download the invoicer.html file, open it in a web browser, or add it to your website.

## FAQ
1. Will there be updates to the file?
   - This was inteded as a one off, but I may do some updates over time.
2. Why is the code format/syntax inconsistent?
   - This is the first project I've built with petite-vue, as such I try to do things in several different ways, so I have additional references for future projects.
3. What's up with the CSS Style?
   - Again, the goal was to see what could be done with the on a single page, so I tried to keep things as simple as possible. I went as minimal as possible
4.  Will there be more apps like this?
    - I do intend to create more apps that follow this pattern.
5. What do I do if something is broken or not working correctly?
   - Feel free to fork the repo and update as you see fit.
